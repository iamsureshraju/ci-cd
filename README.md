# CI/CD Pipeline

This project will:

 - Deploy AWS (ec2) instances
 - Using Terraform to orchestrate and manage tfstate remotely
 - chef-zero to manage node configuration
 - GoCD to manage CI pipeline and handle releases


## Usage

- You will need to setup an s3 bucket and an ssh keypair
 - Update terraform/{main.tf, variables.tf} with your own key
 - Update manage.sh with the location of your s3 bucket

manage.sh is used to store the state of your environment remotely in an s3 bucket

```bash
 Usage: ./manage.sh <plan/apply/show/destroy>
```

The testing of the code (using test.sh), orchestration of your ec2 instanes, and
configuration management using chef-zero can be automated with a CI tool such as GoCD:
